will be adding webrtc to enable video chatting and anonymous group chat feature , 

i am planning to make it really crazy , 

like this really is going to get crazy once i do the anonymous video call feature , 
since that kind of a product is something that is actually getting me excited and 
i will do it really soon,

i am not left with a lot of time  , i have my mid sem exams coming in where i know nothing of what has happened in class , 

but i am going to make it stick .,,


problems that i may face--

1. i am not using core socket io since that is required for signalling,
2. one choice is that i go for i use pusher itself for signalling but idk if that will hold for the changes that i have made ,

3. and the chats are not actually that fast , i dont know if that's working or not, sometimes it does , and sometimes it just utterly fails , first need to fix it properly

4. ofc pusher doesn't provide media streaming, gotta use web rtc for it

5. stun and turn servers , i believe should just import , or else i will just keep on making it big with time
